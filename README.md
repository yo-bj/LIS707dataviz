# Course Materials for Data Visualization for Communication and Decision Making

This repo contains the syllabus and supplimental files for LIS 707 Data Visualization for Communication and Decision Making at UW-Madison. 

Currently the syllabus is available in PDF. One of the TODO items for this repo is to bring the content of the syllabus into various folders for assignments, readings, etc.

# Caveats 

- This is a work in progress. The first run of this syllabus is this fall (!) and will go through changes as the semester progresses.
- There will be some data files in the assignments folder that cannot be included in this repo due to licensing restrictions. I will do my best in giving folks information as to how to get access to the files when this is the case.
- Watch out for any grammatical errors or word omissions. Again, this is a work in progress.

# Acknowledgements 

Many thanks to Bronwen Masemann for the foundation of the syllabus.
