Course Information
==================

Prerequisites:
--------------

-   LIS 603 Research and Evaluation, LIS 705 Intro to Analytics, or an equivalent statistics course strongly recommended
-   Familiarity with Microsoft Excel recommended

Credit Hours: 3
---------------

**Mode**: Asynchronous online course. As an online class, the courseis broken into timed weekly modules. Assignments are due within the week they are assigned. Some assignments may be due on specific days within the week assigned.

**How Credit Hours are Met by Course**: One credit is the learning that takes place in *at least 45 hours* of learning activities, which include time in lectures or online class meetings with the instructor or peers, completing exams, presentations and tutorials, and doing independent reading, writing, studying, or preparation for any of these activities.

A three-credit course, then, would be *at least 135 hours* of work throughout the semester. Expect to spend roughly 10 hours per week on readings, lectures, discussions, exercises, and projects.

Course Description
==================

This course will introduce students to key concepts in data visualization and communication for the purposes of decision making in organizations. Concepts include how and why visualization can be an effective tool for summarizing, analyzing and communicating about data, as well as the limitations and challenges in using data visualizations, including misrepresentation and bias. Students will receive hands-on experience with Excel and Tableau to develop visualizations and presentations as well as plan appropriate types of visualization(s) based on source data, audience, and goals.

Course Objectives
=================

**How This Class Works**

This is an asynchronous distance course, so it does not "meet" at a regular time. Work assigned for each unit must be completed within the week ([a week being Tuesday midnight Central Time to Monday midnight]{.ul} [Central Time of each week]{.ul}) unless otherwise directed by the individual assignment. Furthermore, each student can complete the work at a time within that week that works best for their schedule. Week units may include: asynchronous lecturers, software tutorials, student discussions, group and individual activities, synchronous meetings, and required readings.

Optional -- Weekly Synch Sessions
---------------------------------

On **Thursdays** during the semester there will be an open hour for discussion of relevant topics for the week as well as provide time for students to ask questions about the week's topics. Students are not required to participate in these sessions but are encouraged to take advantage of these sessions whenever possible.

Students are also encouraged to bring questions or relevant topics to discuss at the synch sessions. If you miss a synchronous session, you may watch the video of the  session up to seven days after the recording.

Course Policies and Statements
==============================

Late Project Work Excused due to Illness or Emergency
-----------------------------------------------------

Late work will be *excused without penalty* in the case of serious illness in self or family, bereavement and other emergencies: please contact me as soon as possible in these cases, but please look after self and family first!

Submission of Assignments
-------------------------

Assignments should be submitted by 11:30 p.m. Central Time on the date they are due. I will likely take longer to return late assignments, so you will not have the benefit of prompt feedback in preparing the next assignment.

For **Projects** - Late assignments *without an accepted excuse* will be marked down 10 percentage points per 24- hour period after the due date.

For **Class Exercises** -- The main purpose for the class exercises is to gain proficiency in the weekly topic or tool being used that week. Resubmissions of work when corrections need to be made will not be counted as late work if the resubmission is made before the end of the following week of the original due date.

For **Discussion Forums** -- No credit will be given for participation done after the assignment deadline for that week.

**OPTIONAL - R**

This course contains an optional module where students can explore creating data visualizations using R via Rstudio, an integrated development environment (IDE). Instructions to install R and RStudio are on the Canvas site.

**A note about troubleshooting visualization tools** -- Working with technology means dealing the rapid pace of change that technology entails: updates, software bugs, changing features, deprecated functionality, or even the discontinuation of applications or file formats (e.g. flash files no longer playing in browsers). Students are encouraged to make a good faith effort in troubleshooting technical issues, including reading documentation, technical Q&A sites such as Stack Overflow, DoIT Help Desk (for campus-owned software), and their class peers (via discussion board, private messaging, etc.), before turning to the instructor or TA for troubleshooting help.
 Remember, sometimes walking away from a problem for a short while can help you solve it -- read https://psychology.stackexchange.com/questions/1/how-is-it-that-taking-a-break-from-a-problem-sometimes-allows-you-to-figure-out to find out more about this psychological phenomenon. It might be also worthwhile to invest in a rubber duck - https://rubberduckdebugging.com/.

Brief Assignment Descriptions
----------------------------------
*Full instructions and rubrics for each assignment will be posted in Canvas.*

**Class Exercises**

Students will be required to complete short exercises to practice visualization skills.

**Section Quizzes**

At the end of each section, there will be a quiz that covers the main discussions and readings in each section. Quizzes will be open book/notes, but all students must complete the quiz work on their own.

**Participation in Online Discussion Forums**

Students will be required to participate in weekly forum discussions based on the topics covered in the class that week. Students can choose which weeks they participate in as long as they participate in at least ten weekly discussions at the end of the course.

**Visualization Makeover Presentation**

Students will find and select a data visualization from an external source and improve the visualization using the skills and techniques learned in class. When the source data may not be available for recreating the visualization, a polished illustration of the improved visualization is an option. Students will record a five- minute online presentation presenting their makeover, covering the following:

-   The source of the original visualization (organization, where the visualization was used, data source), and what it was trying to convey (and who it was trying to convey to)
-   The main issues with the original visualization
-   What improvements were made to address the main issues

**Final Project**

There will be no final exam, only the final project. The final project will be a policy brief with, at minimum, three different types of data visualizations. Please submit your final brief as a Word Document or PDF. It's okay to direct the reader to an interactive version of the visualization in the brief, but for the brief itself please use static visualizations.

From The Writing Center of North Carolina at Chapel Hill [1], a policy brief is:
>"... a concise summary of information that can help readers
> understand, and likely make decisions about, government policies.
> Policy briefs may give objective summaries of relevant research,
> suggest possible policy options, or go even further and argue for
> particular courses of action."

An example of a policy brief can be found in the link to Chapel Hill's Writing Center website, as well as near the end of the ICPA's guide to writing policy briefs -
https://www.icpolicyadvocacy.org/sites/icpa/files/downloads/icpa_policy_briefs_essential_guide.pdf (starting at page 23).

*This project's focus is writing policy briefs for decision-makers.* These briefs can cover a variety of topics, including but not limited to organizational policy, budget allocation, or services/programs offered by the organization. The decision-makers can also vary, depending on the situation: organization administration, board members, government officials, university/college officials, school superintendents, your boss, etc.

Students can use a data source of their choosing with approval of the instructor. Here are some resources for civic open data for students looking for possible data sets:

-   IMLS data - https://www.imls.gov/research-tools/data-collection
-   Civic open data sets
    -   Madison, WI - http://data-cityofmadison.opendata.arcgis.com/
    -   Seattle, WA - https://data.seattle.gov/

    -   https://catalog.data.gov/dataset has a list of cities with existing open data sets. Clicking on the location name links will lead you (eventually) to the data portal for that city.

The final project will have interim assignments throughout the semester to ensure students are on track with the assignment, including:

1.  a proposal about the topic of the brief, including data source and targeted audience,
2.  draft brief narrative, and
3.  draft visualizations.
