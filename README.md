# Course Materials for Data Visualization for Communication and Decision Making

This repo contains the syllabus and supplimental files for LIS 707 Data Visualization for Communication and Decision Making at UW-Madison. 


# Caveats 

- This syllabus is and will be forever in beta. Each time the course is taught the readings, assignments, etc. are subject to change to reflect current examples and issues around data visualization.
- There will be some data files in the assignments folder that cannot be included in this repo due to licensing restrictions. I will do my best in giving folks information as to how to get access to the files when this is the case.
- Watch out for any grammatical errors or word omissions. 

# Acknowledgements 

Many thanks to Bronwen Masemann for the foundation of the syllabus.
